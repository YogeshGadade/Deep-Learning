## Using Tesseract in Python
  Please refer following files:

  English sample 2, NoisyImage.png, hindi sample with different fonts.png

  For tilted image containing a text to be read we can correct the angle and then read the text using tessract for more accuracy for this please refer this code file: End_to_end_Auto_Image_tilt_angle_detection_and_correction.ipynb and input file: DemoImage.png
  For automatic cropping of white border refer this link: https://github.com/Yogeshnaik1190/Pre-processing
