# About Project
Chatbot that can respond for input utterance 

# Chatbot:
1. Using Transformer from scratch
2. Sentiment based: BERT + SVM and RF
3. Sentiment based: RNN + Beam Search


# Input Dataset: Topical Chat (conversation )
https://github.com/alexa/Topical-Chat/tree/master/conversations

### Challanges faced
1. Computational capacity 
2. Library installation 
3. Time of execution + testing different hyperparameter for tuning 
4. On cloud based platform Google Colab faced tensorflow errors ( same code was working on local laptop )

NOTE: Due to computational capacity I have used sample of complete dataset hence focus is on model working and tuning instead of accuracy
